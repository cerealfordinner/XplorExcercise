## About The Project
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19718611/168489877-4963b0d3-9555-4649-9031-a5fc541a5127.png)

This  project uses a third-party API to pull down all customers onto the home page using Blazor and C# to enter each customer into a Bootstrap grid.

Features:
* Load all customers onto the home page
* Delete any customer using the delete button
* Search for a customer using the search option at the top of the table
* Use the create page to add a new customer

What I was able to get to:
* The edit button would allow a PUT request to be constructed to update the customer

This was a really fun practice project and while I wasn't able to finish it in time I did learn a lot and if the API is stil up I plan coming back to try and finish it.
